# WebGPU

WebGPU is the new standard for accelerated rendering and computing in the browser using GPUs.

This example is a slightly modified version of the Basic Render Pipeline example in the Mozilla Developer Network web docs site:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API

As of May 2023, this example should run on Chrome versions from 113, including browsers based on Chromium like Edge or Brave. It should run also on Firefox nightly build.
